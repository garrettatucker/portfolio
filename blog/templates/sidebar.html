        <p class="card-text">I am a Junior Full Stack developer with strengths in Python and
            JavaScript. This site was built using the Django framework, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have
            been tinkering with websites ever since my grandma took me to a children's website
            development class when I was in elementary school. I believe that this site
            holds some of my best projects (so far) that can be checked out above. Also feel free to check
            out my links below.
